 * Note that since multiple equipped items may provide the same or similar
 * modifiers (specifically Buffs), any time one is unequipped and removes
 * its modifier, it could negate a bonus (or penalty) granted by another.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * To get around this, any time an equipped slot changes state, ALL of the
 * slots will first be "unequipped" to remove all modifiers, then re-equipped.

 * Unfortunately, this does not re-apply modifiers from any other source, so
 * if a player had e.g. Buff.EVADE_UP from something other than an IEquipTrigger
 * item and unequipped the Pegasus Boots, they would lose their evasion buff.
